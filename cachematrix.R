## makeCacheMatrix stores matrix inversions in memory to speed up search time.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve will create a matrix inversion if one has not already been cached;
## if one has been cached, then it will pull it from memory.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
